# Supermarket-Billing-System

Welcome to the Supermarket Billing System project! This system is implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to efficiently manage the billing process in a supermarket.
## Features

- **Billing System**
  - Generate bills for customers
  - Calculate total price including taxes
  - Apply discounts and promotions

- **User Management**
  - User authentication for staff

## OOP Concepts Used

- **Classes and Objects**
  - Product, Bill, User, and Supermarket classes encapsulate related data and functions

- **Encapsulation**
  - Data members are kept private, accessible only through public member functions

- **Inheritance**
  - Different types of users (e.g., Cashier, Manager) inherit from a base User class

- **Polymorphism**
  - Function overriding allows for customized behavior for different user roles

- **Abstraction**
  - Simplifies complex billing operations by hiding implementation details

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
